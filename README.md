# Java Swing Calculator

A robust and modular calculator application built with **Java Swing**. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by handling different mathematical operations in separate classes.

##  Features 

* **Standard Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
* **Advanced Math:**
    * Square Root (`Karekok.java`)
    * Power/Exponentiation (`UsAlma.java`)
    * Percentage Calculation (`Yuzde.java`)
    * Inverse (`BirBoluX.java`)
* **User Interface:** Clean and responsive GUI designed with Java Swing.
* **Modular Codebase:** Each operation is managed by its own class for better maintainability.

##  Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **GUI Library:** Java Swing & AWT
* **IDE:** Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

##  Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure where each operation is a separate class:
- `HesapMakinesi.java` - Main entry point and GUI setup.
- `Toplama.java`, `Cikarma.java`, etc. - Operation logic.
- `Islem.java` - Base interface/class for operations.
